# description for this 'dots'
---
I am at ***12th grade - 17 years old***. wanna make this repo in order to capture some nice moments when I am exploring this crazy OS.

First of all, I came up on Linux with '**Mint**', but I can not use it for a '**min**'. because of its weird way of using (not at all). and it is too similar to Windows (**Windows**, yeh, that is the main reason that I make me want to switch toward Linux)

Secondary, I right pick **Arch Linux**. btw. I love **Arch** so much. Init came with *hyprland* (de & wm) by *prasanthrangan*. After learned something new through YouTube videos, Linux communities, etc.. anything I found that suitable with my characteristics, I will do the changes immediately. 

This is my first (*absolutely trolled*) commitment for the change logs. I also created a *change logs txt* in order to update my perspectives about this OS onto it. I might write (yap) a lot to improve my writing skill lol. However. btw. Welcome to my '***dotees***'

Initializing Linux-ing. *Long Hoang*. since ***2025.04.21***.
